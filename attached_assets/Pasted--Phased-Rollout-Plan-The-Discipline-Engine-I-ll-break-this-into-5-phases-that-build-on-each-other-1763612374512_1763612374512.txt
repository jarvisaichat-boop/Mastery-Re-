🚀 Phased Rollout Plan: The Discipline Engine
I'll break this into 5 phases that build on each other, starting with quick wins that enhance what you already have, then progressively adding the infrastructure for the full vision.

Phase 1: Foundation Enhancements ⚡
Build on existing Micro-Win Protocol

What we're adding:

Emergency Latch: "I'm Overwhelmed" toggle that shrinks ALL habits to 60-second micro-wins
Streak Repair: Popup when user missed yesterday - "Do a 60s action RIGHT NOW to save your streak"
Enhanced Hold-to-Ignite: Dark timer (screen goes black during countdown, only shows completion)
Why first: Uses infrastructure you already have (Micro-Win Protocol, habit data, localStorage)

Phase 2: Smart Notification System 🔔
The "Drill Sergeant" trigger escalation

What we're adding:

Notification Service: Browser notifications with escalation logic (T-5 gentle → T-0 urgent → T+5 buzzing)
Habit Scheduling: Set custom times for each habit
Direct-to-Ignition Flow: Clicking notification opens a focused habit card (NOT dashboard)
One-Button Interface: Single glowing "Hold-to-Ignite" button on habit cards
Why second: This is the core "hook" that pulls users back into the app

Phase 3: Dual-Engine System 🎭
Follower Mode vs Leader Mode

What we're adding:

Engine Mode Selection: Per-habit toggle (Follower/Leader/Balanced)
Follower Tools:
Visual Pacer (breathing circle animation)
Audio Player (guided meditation/workout tracks)
Leader Enforcement:
Snooze Tax (5 squats to dismiss notification)
Countdown Lockdown (can't exit until timer completes)
Why third: Requires notification system from Phase 2 to be meaningful

Phase 4: Advanced Enforcement 📸
Proof-of-Work & Consequences

What we're adding:

Camera Lock: Must take photo of gym/book to close habit
External Action Bridge: Deep links to other apps (Strava, Spotify, etc.)
Offline Arsenal: Make Follower/Leader tools available outside app (Day 0+)
Why fourth: Complex integrations - camera API, external app routing, offline capability

Phase 5: Polish & Optimization ✨
The final touches

What we're adding:

Performance Optimization: Reduce notification battery drain
Analytics Dashboard: Track which engine modes work best
Smart Defaults: AI suggests Follower/Leader based on habit type
Open Arsenal Rule: All tools available from Day 0 (no waiting period)
Why last: Refinement after seeing how users interact with core systems

📊 Visual Roadmap:
Phase 1 (Week 1)     → Emergency features on existing foundation
Phase 2 (Week 2-3)   → Notification system (the "hook")
Phase 3 (Week 4-5)   → Dual-Engine personality
Phase 4 (Week 6-7)   → Advanced enforcement
Phase 5 (Week 8)     → Polish & analytics

💡 My Recommendation:
Start with Phase 1 - it's high-impact, low-complexity, and immediately makes the app more powerful. Emergency Latch alone could be a game-changer for overwhelmed users.
